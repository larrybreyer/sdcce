        <h3>Masthead elements</h3>
        <p>
          On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation 
          and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the 
          charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, 
          that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are 
          bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail 
          in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same 
          as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.

        <h3>Main elements</h3>
        <p>
          These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish.
          In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled 
          and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like 
          best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided.

          But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty 
          or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that 
          pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted.

        <h3>Additional elements</h3>
        <p>
          The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to 
          this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure 
          other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid 
          worse pains.

        But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of 
        denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will 
        give you a complete account of the system, and expound the 
        actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the 
        master-builder of human happiness.
