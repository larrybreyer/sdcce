                    Evolution occurs when a random genetic change gives the carrier of the genetic
material the advantage of being able to survive and, more importantly,
reproduce more efficiently. As a result, his or her genetic material becomes
the dominant genetic material until further changes allow the individual to
adapt even better to the conditions of life. Constant changes in the
environment (which includes all other evolving creatures) continue to drive
this selection mechanism toward a randomly altered but ever better adapted
genome. Thus, chance and necessity are equally the driving forces of any
evolutionary development, as described by the French molecular biologist and
Nobel laureate Jacques Lucien Monod (1910-1976) in his natural philosophical
work of the same name.

                    However, due to advanced cultural development, human adaptation to new or
changing living conditions is now less genetic and more technological. We
ourselves have become the engine of rapid change in nature. Our now dominant
influence on our environment through technology (geochronologically, we speak
of the Anthropocene) may be one of the reasons why, despite the natural origin
of our species, we mistakenly believe ourselves to be outside of nature. The
fact that we have emerged from this natural process does not mean that we have
outgrown it. On the contrary, the selection conditions of that time are our
needs of today. The fatal consequences of this misbelief can be seen, among
other things, in the pandemic scale of the so-called diseases of civilization,
including the way humankind reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic and how we are in
the process of losing our humanity; more on this later. Furthermore,
technological solutions are faster than genetic adaptations. For example,
building dams to create new habitats or to protect already populated areas
from flooding has proven beneficial to our species. We do not have to rely on
a long natural adaptation process (like developing gills, which are actually
created during human embryonic development, but are then remodeled into other
structures again).

                    Nevertheless, every technical innovation is also subject to a basically
identical evolutionary mechanism of chance and necessity. People have ideas;
those that are most likely to satisfy a certain need or solve a certain
problem are held on to and investigated further. This is the first step of
selection. The second then is usually experimental verification. Sometimes a
solution abruptly influences the lives of very many people; then we speak of a
cultural development. The invention of the automobile or the cell phone was
thus subject to evolutionary mechanisms analogous to mutation (random ideas)
and selection (better adaptation to living conditions or satisfaction of a
need), just like the emergence of new species first described by Darwin. And
as with all phenomena in which chance plays a role, this is a statistically
predictable process. For example, the more viruses that exist or circulate,
the greater the probability that we will come into contact with one that can
bypass our immune system. In the case of the viruses that infect our
respiratory tract, such as influenza, RSV, or coronavirus, such mutations tend
to be very common because their genome consists of single-stranded RNA, which
does not allow for proofreading as our double-stranded DNA-based genome. The
high number of these seasonal viruses produced worldwide in the course of an
infection wave and the very high mutation rate are the two main reasons why
herd immunity can never develop against these viruses and vaccination programs
are doomed to fail. The secret of the virus's success is the strategy of a
high reproduction rate combined with a high mutation rate.
