Directory contents

    ./lab16.org/
    ./lab17.org/
    ./lab18.org/

The above directories are a composite of the contents of these ZIP archives:

    ~/Desktop/Docs/CompTIA/COMP_690/M11/lab16.zip
    ~/Desktop/Docs/CompTIA/COMP_690/M11/lab17.zip
    ~/Desktop/Docs/CompTIA/COMP_690/M11/lab18.zip

... and the notes I take duing Zak's strange lectures.

The JavaScript files in the ZIP archives are empty.
The only value to the archives is the index.html and possible style.css
files which provide the environment for the JavaScript.

The index.html and style.css files provide a starting place for the browser.
A day or two after the lecture during which I create the script.js files,
Zak will publish the solutions to Canvas.
