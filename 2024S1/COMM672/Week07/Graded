What I─missed─

Instructions:
Make sure you include the following items:

 •  Use semnatic HTML 5

 •  Format the text using some of the font techniques we have covered in class

 •  Use a CSS─reset─on this webpage

 •  Create a navigation bar and use flexbox to control the spacing. You will
    need to incorporate links and a─logo─or text based company name

 •  For the header element:

     o  use a background image (this about the various ways in which you can
        control the positioning of the background image within the header
        element). Feel free to use your own image or get one from
        https://unsplash.com

     o  Make sure that the text is readable over the image, you may need to
        use a drop shadow or two to aid in readability.

     o  Create a─split screen─design in the header using flexbox.

 •  Make sure all of your code is valid (use the validators!)

Hey Larry,

    you did not include a─reset─file as specified in the instructions.

    Please avoid using divs, unless there is no other semantic solution,
    a─div─is not necessary for this assignment.

    In the navigation area, you should have included a─logo─of some sort, in
    addition to the navigational links.

    You did not include the─split screen─technique that was demonstrated in
    this weeks, lecture material, and requested to be included in this
    assignment.
