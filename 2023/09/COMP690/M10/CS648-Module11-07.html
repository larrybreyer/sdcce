      <h5>The idea of insects as a primary food source for humanity, also known as
        <abbr title="bugs"><em>entomophagy</em></abbr>, has gained attention due to 
        several reasons</h5>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-3">
        <strong>Sustainability:</strong> Insects are incredibly efficient at
        converting feed into protein. They often require fewer resources (such as
        water, land, and feed) compared to traditional livestock like cows, pigs,
        or chickens. They emit fewer greenhouse gases and can be reared using
        organic waste.
      </div>
      <div class="col-3">
        <strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Many insects are rich in protein,
        healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals. For example, crickets, mealworms,
        and grasshoppers are high in protein and contain essential amino acids,
        making them a nutritious food source.
      </div>
      <div class="col-3">
        <strong>Cultural Acceptance:</strong> Insects are already consumed as
        a regular part of diets in various cultures around the world. Over 2
        billion people globally eat insects as part of their traditional diets.
      </div>
      <div class="col-3">
        <strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> With the growing concern about
        the environmental impact of meat production, exploring alternative protein
        sources like insects becomes crucial to mitigate the strain on resources and
        reduce environmental degradation.
